# Angular blog

Angular 4 front-end of a simple MEAN stack application that i call "blog" for no reason since i get my inspiration from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [imgur]('https://imgur.com/').

API server is [here](https://github.com/mouchabeurre/blog-server).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
